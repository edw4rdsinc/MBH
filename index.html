Awesome — here’s a single, bulletproof prompt you can paste into your coding AI to generate the **entire MBH site as one mobile‑first `.html` file** (HTML + internal CSS + a tiny bit of vanilla JS). It bakes in your constraints: Vercel deploy, subtle premium animations, upgraded typography, colors derived from the current site/logo, SEO/OG/JSON‑LD, and **verbatim copy/layout**.

---

## PROMPT: Build a Single‑File HTML Site for My Benefits Help (MBH)

**Goal:** Produce a **single `.html` file** (no external assets) that renders the full MBH website (Homepage, Brokers, Employers, Resources, About, Contact) using the **exact copy and section order** below.
**Platform:** Will be deployed on **Vercel** (static hosting).
**Style:** Clean, fresh, premium. **Subtle** motion only. **Mobile‑first**.

### 0) Brand & Styling Requirements

* **Color palette:** Derive HEX colors from the **MBH logo and current site** at `www.mybenefitshelp.net`. Create CSS variables in `:root`:

  ```css
  :root{
    --mbh-bg:#ffffff;
    --mbh-fg:#0f172a;        /* dark text */
    --mbh-muted:#475569;     /* secondary text */
    --mbh-primary: <derive from logo>;
    --mbh-accent:  <complimentary to primary>;
    --mbh-border:#e2e8f0;    /* hairlines */
    --mbh-card:#ffffff;
  }
  ```

  * Ensure contrast ≥ WCAG AA. If any derived color fails contrast for text, darken it \~10–20%.
* **Typography (upgrade from current site):** Load Google Fonts inline (no network preconnects needed). Use:

  * Headings: **Inter** or **Work Sans**, 600/700
  * Body: **Inter** 400/500
* **Layout:** Mobile‑first grid/flex; max content width \~1120–1200px; generous white space.
* **Components:** sticky header, skip‑link, hero with CTA trio, logo wall, testimonial cards, CTA band, audience pages, Resources action hub grid, About with team placeholders, Contact with quick links + three audience links.
* **Animations (subtle only):**

  * Fade‑in + slight rise on section entry (intersection observer). Duration \~250–400ms; ease `cubic-bezier(.2,.65,.3,1)`.
  * Logo wall gentle marquee that **pauses on hover**; reduce motion if user prefers.
  * CTA hover: scale 1.02 + subtle shadow.
  * Respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → disable animations.
* **Icons:** Use simple Unicode/emoji for buttons (📄 🔄 🩺 ☎) as in copy; no external icon sets.
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA, visible `:focus-visible`, semantic landmarks (`header/nav/main/section/footer`), single H1 per page view (H1 on the homepage hero; internal sections use H2/H3), alt text for decorative shapes set to `aria-hidden="true"`.

### 1) Technical Constraints

* **Single HTML file** with:

  * `<style>` block (all CSS)
  * `<script>` block (only for: animation observers, year auto-update, minimal menu toggle)
* **No external JS/CSS** (Google Fonts link allowed).
* **Vercel‑friendly:** Valid HTML5; no build step needed.
* **Routing:** Since it’s a single file, implement **section anchors** for nav:

  * `/brokers` → `#brokers`
  * `/employers` → `#employers`
  * `/resources` → `#resources`
  * `/about` → `#about`
  * `/contact` → `#contact`
  * Home → `#home`
  * All buttons/links in the copy should point to these anchors accordingly.
* **Contact placeholders:**

  * Phone: `tel:+1-000-000-0000`
  * Email: `mailto:hello@mybenefitshelp.net`
  * Live Chat: `#contact`
* **Resources placeholders:** use `href="#todo-<slug>"` with HTML comments `<!-- TODO: replace with live URL -->`.
* **Footer year:** Auto‑set to current year via JS.

### 2) SEO / Analytics

* `<title>`: “Benefits Service for Brokers & Small Employers | My Benefits Help”
* `<meta name="description">`: “Nationwide, people‑first benefits support for brokers, employers, and employees. Smarter, simpler service without extra overhead.”
* **Open Graph:** title, description, type `website`, url `https://www.mybenefitshelp.net`, placeholder image `og-image.png` (omit the file, keep the meta).
* **JSON‑LD (Organization)** with name, url, sameAs (empty array).
* **Analytics placeholders:** Commented block for Vercel Analytics or Google Tag; do not load scripts.

### 3) Header / Nav

* Left: wordmark text “My Benefits Help” (use primary color; allow for future SVG logo).
* Right: nav links → Home, Brokers, Employers, Resources, About, Contact (anchor links).
* Sticky, translucent background on scroll, 1px border `--mbh-border`.
* Mobile: hamburger → slide‑down menu.
